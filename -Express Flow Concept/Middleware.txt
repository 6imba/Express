- app.use(express.static(staticPath)); will overwrite app.get(), because it follows to to bottom rule.
- In express.js every thing is middleware.
- middleware is like checking between request and response.
- require("express")().use(middlewareName)
- require("express")().use('',middlewareName)


# Using Middleware:
    - execute middleware using use funtion.
    1. app.use(middlewareName):
        - It mounts the specified middleware_function to all request path.
    2. app.use([path], [callback1,callback2,........])
        - It mounts the specified middleware_function at the specified path.
        - middleware_function gets executed only when base path of request matches.

- every route, app is middleware.
