- If you need to create a your own restful api, we have a CRUD operation and for that crud operation we have a equivalent http verb/method.

# http verb/method:
    - create ==> post http_method
    - read ==> get http_method
    - update ==> put/patch http_method
    - delete ==> delete http_method

# end-point/route/api:
    - get ==> api/users
    - post ==> api/create-users
    - patch/put ==> api/update-users
    - delete ==> api/delete-users

# RESTFUL end-point/route/api:
    - get ==> api/user
    - post ==> api/user
    - get ==> api/user/67
    - patch/put ==> api/user/12
    - delete ==> api/user/22
